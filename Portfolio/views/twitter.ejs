        <h2>Mock Twitter Mobile App</h2>
        <p>This app is mostly the basics of twitter: text posts you can scroll through. The posts are public to any users, there are no "followers."</p>

            <p>In this app, you must be a user to access the content. Once you are registered as a user and logged in, you can see the posts 
                that are public for any user to see and post on. Posts update in real time.

                This app functions very much like the basics of Twitter. A user can make a text post that is stored in a public list of posts. 
                You can navigate through the pages of posts by clicking the numbers on the bottom. A user can create a post by clicking the button on the top. 
                This project has some issues that have yet to be resolved, for example: a user is not able to delete a post and the trash icon 
                is shown on every post, regardless if the user is the owner or not.

            <p>
                A user will enter the text they want and then click submit. The app will automatically put the user's name and when they posted on the post.
